* Data Visualization: [C3](http://c3js.org/)
* Testing: [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) (BDD Unit Test Framework), [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) (Unit Test Runner), [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/) (E2E Framework), [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) (Code Coverage)
* Linting: [TsLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) (Linting for TypeScript)
* Logging: [js-Logger](https://github.com/jonnyreeves/js-logger) (JavaScript Logger)
* Code Analysis: [Codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer) (TsLint rules for static code analysis of Angular 2 TypeScript projects)

## Quick Start

**Make sure you have node version >= 6.x.x**

## environments

We provide various sample environments out of the box which make it easier to get started.
The environments are provided as bash scripts in `environments`. To use them run:

```bash
source environments/<environment-name>.sh
```

For example, to connect to devshift:

```bash
source environments/devshift-cluster.sh
```

### git clone

Clone/download the repo start editing `app.component.ts` inside [`/src/app/`](/src/app/app.component.ts)

```bash
# clone our repo
git clone https://github.com/fabric8-ui/fabric8-runtime-console.git
cd fabric8-runtime-console
```

### build

```bash
# install the dependencies
npm install

# start the server
npm start
```


### Proxying

We also have built in support for proxying your requests to the OpenShift cluster - this is particularly
useful if your OpenShift cluster doesn't support CORS. By default the console will access the proxy on the
same protocl, host and port as the app is running. You can adjust this using environment variables, and the
sample environments provide good examples of doing this.

### Open the console in your browser

Now go to [http://0.0.0.0:4200](http://0.0.0.0:4200) or [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.

**NOTE** often openshift clusters don't have valid certs so when you go to the web console in the cluster your browser shows you a warning about the cert not being valid and asks you if you are sure.

If you don't get a login page your browser may be hiding the login page for this reason.

If so try open the console for the cluster you are trying to access. e.g. https://int.rdu2c.fabric8.io:8443/console/ then going through the browser windows to get to the login page so that you accept the cert. 

Then try reload your tab on [http://0.0.0.0:4200](http://0.0.0.0:4200) and you hopefully will get the login page!

### If you don't have a kubernetes or openshift cluster

To setup your own local kubernetes or openshift cluster the [fabric8 getting started guide](https://fabric8.io/guide/getStarted/gofabric8.html)

Or you can setup `kubectl` or `oc` to point to a known cluster.

### File Structure

We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app, usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

What you need to run this app:

* `node` (`brew install node` for OS X users)
* `yarn` (see [https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install))
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v6.x.x`+ and Yarn

### Installing

* `fork` the ipaas repo
* `clone` your fork
* `yarn` to install all dependencies
* `npm start` to start the dev server

### Running

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `ng serve` to start a local server which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:4200` (or if you prefer IPv6, then it's `http://[::1]:4200/`).

#### Development

# in one shell to expose your kubernetes cluster:
```bash
kubectl proxy
```

```bash
npm start
```

#### Production

```bash
ng serve --prod -aot
```

For a list of common commands, see [here](/docs/commands.md).

## Testing

### Watch and Run Tests

```bash
ng test
```

### Run Tests

```bash
ng test --watch=false
```

For a list of common commands, see [here](/docs/commands.md).

## Configuring

Configuration files live in `/config`. Configuration files are currently available for Webpack, Karma, and Protractor.

## Contributing

Pull requests are always welcome. Please read through our [Contribution](/docs/contributing.md) guidelines in the `/docs` directory.
